# Optimization-Course-Homeworks
This repository contains my homework assignments for the Optimization course at MIPT.
Optimization is the process of finding the best solution to a problem under given constraints. 
In the Optimization course, we learned various optimization techniques and their applications. 
The course covered both convex and non-convex optimization problems.

In this course I implemented control by landing of spaceship,
nonnegative matrix factorization and various optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, conjugate gradient, and Newton's method.
